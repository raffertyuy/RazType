This function contains a C# Azure function code (in .NET 6) to convert a webm file that comes from a Power App microphone recording.
It is a single file because it is meant to be copy-pasted to Azure Functions - Code in Portal.

Original source is from [here](https://kamdaryash.wordpress.com/2020/02/03/create-a-pdf-file-of-text-converted-from-speech-recorded-in-powerapps-using-azure-cognitive-services/), but the code is outdated.
Eventually got an updated code from [markharrison](https://github.com/markharrison/azfunction-webm-to-wav). This code contains my tweaks to the above code.
